**About My Work**

This is a simple exploration of touch and gesture mobile features! Explore different emotions and background color schemes to make different pieces. 

**What I Made**

When the screen is clicked anywhere, a happy face icon appears. When double tapped, an angry face icon appears. The user can zoom in and out using the pinch gesture. They can also swipe up, down, right, or left to change the background color. Lastly, by holding down on the screen for 3 seconds they can clear the emojis on the screen and start again!  

**About the Layout**

Background: Created a gradient in the background and had it ignore safe areas to cover the entire screen
Variables: created state variables to contain/control object locations, scale, and the background colors
Gestures: single tap, double tap, drag (swipe), pinch (zoom), or long press
